# spot-tty

A Spotify TUI for your terminal — built with Rust and ratatui.
Works standalone in any terminal, and as a floating Neovim plugin.

## Install

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gaurav-Gali/spot-tty/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows** (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gaurav-Gali/spot-tty/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer will:

1. Install Rust if not already present
2. Clone and build spot-tty from source
3. Place the binary on your PATH
4. Ask for your Spotify API credentials and save them
5. (macOS/Linux) Optionally install the Neovim plugin

> **Requires:** git, curl (macOS/Linux) or PowerShell 5+ (Windows). Rust is installed automatically.

## Spotify setup

You need a free Spotify Developer app to get API credentials:

1. Go to [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Click **Create app** (any name/description)
3. In app **Settings → Redirect URIs** add: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
4. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** — the installer will ask for these

> **Important:** Spotify apps start in Development Mode. To use write features (queue), go to **Settings → User Management** and add your Spotify account email.

## Usage

### Terminal

```bash
spot-tty
```

On first launch a browser window opens for Spotify OAuth. After that, credentials are cached at `~/.config/spot-tty/token.json`.

### Neovim

Press `<leader>ts` to open spot-tty in a floating window.
Press `q` to close and return to your code.

Or run `:SpotTty` from the command line.

RSPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id

You can also set these as shell environment variables instead of using the file.

## Neovim plugin

The installer sets this up automatically. To configure manually, add to your lazy.nvim config:

```lua
return {
  dir = vim.fn.expand("~/.config/nvim/plugins/spot-tty.nvim"),
  config = function()
    require("spot-tty").setup({
      binary    = vim.fn.expand("~/.local/bin/spot-tty"),
      keymap    = "<leader>ts",   -- set to false to disable
      width     = 0.85,           -- fraction of editor width
      height    = 0.85,           -- fraction of editor height
      border    = "rounded",      -- "rounded"|"single"|"double"|"solid"
      title     = " 󰝚  spot-tty ",
    })
  end,
}
```

Then run `:Lazy sync` inside Neovim.

rm ~/.local/bin/spot-tty
rm -rf ~/.config/spot-tty
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/plugins/spot-tty.nvim
